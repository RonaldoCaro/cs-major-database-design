# CS2 Austin Major â€“ Database Project

This project focuses on designing and testing a relational database based on information from the **CS2 Austin Major**.  
The main goal was to apply **data normalization** and run SQL queries to explore insights about players and teams.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
DATA DESIGN/
â”‚â”€â”€ players.csv # Player data (name, nationality, role, rating, maps played)
â”‚â”€â”€ teams.csv # Team data (name, stage started, stage ended, final position)
â”‚â”€â”€ csaustingmajor-ERD.png # Entity-Relationship Diagram of the model
â”‚â”€â”€ db.sql # SQL script to create the database

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Collect and organize information about **players** and **teams** from the Austin Major.  
- Apply **normalization** principles to create a clean relational database with minimal redundancy.  
- Run SQL queries to test the structure and validate the dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Main Tables
### Players
- `player_id` (PK)  
- `name`  
- `nationality`  
- `role`  
- `maps_played`  
- `rating`  

### Teams
- `team_id` (PK)  
- `name`  
- `stage_started`  
- `stage_ended`  
- `final_position`

## ðŸ”Ž Queries
Some of the queries implemented include:
- Listing players with the highest rating.  
- Joining players with their corresponding teams.  
- Ranking teams based on their final tournament position.  

Results are available in `QueriesAnswer.xlsx`.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

This is an introductory project focused on practicing database design and normalization.
While the structure is simple, it provided hands-on experience with modeling, SQL queries, and documentation.
